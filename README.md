# indexed-priority-queue 
This is my implementation of a modified Priority Queue, adding functionality for modifying element priorities online in O(logn) complexity.
Such Data Structure might be used to optimize Dijkstra's algorithm to its best known complexity, O(|E| + |V|log|V|), a bound also achieved by using a Fibonacci Heap, which is arguably harder to implement. I plan on benchmarking their efficiency thus comparing hidden constants in the asymptotics.
